# GlassPen ✍️  A Chrome Extension with Built-in AI

I was reading a machine learning article and found it tough to follow.

That’s when it hit me:  
**What if I could just draw, highlight, and take notes right on the webpage?**

So I built **GlassPen** — a Chrome extension with **built-in AI**.

## 🚀 Why I Built It

I needed it.  
Reading technical articles often left me stuck or overwhelmed. GlassPen helps break things down visually and mentally — all without leaving the page.  
*(Alhamdulillah)*
